					<p>After a lackluster console generation with the Wii U, Nintendo managed to turn things
						around with the much-beloved Nintendo Switch: a cross between a handheld and traditional game console. Since
						its launch in
						March 2017, we've seen the console get a revised version with improved battery life and a new Switch Lite
						model designed solely for handheld use. In light of these changes, it's high time to revisit the Switch and
						reassess the platform's quality as the console enters its third year.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="theReview">
					<h3>Nintendo Switch price and availability</h3>
					<p>
						The standard Nintendo Switch, available with either Neon Red and Neon Blue or gray Joy-Con controllers, has
						a list price of $299.99 (279.99 pounds sterling). There never tend to be huge discounts on Switch consoles,
						even during big sales like Black Friday, but you can sometimes find it with a few dollars or pounds off when
						it's bundled with one or more games. For comparison, the Switch Lite costs $199.99 (199.99 pounds).
					</p>
					<p>
						You can buy the Switch from many popular retailers, including Amazon U.S., Best Buy, GameStop, Target and
						Walmart in the United States; or Amazon, Argos, Game and Currys or the Nintendo Store in the United Kingdom.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nintendo also offers some limited edition Switches with special designs, for example the Animal Crossing:
						New Horizons-themed one below.
					</p>

					<h3>Nintendo Switch design</h3>
					<p>
						Like most modern consoles, the Switch has a fairly unremarkable design: rectangles mixed with a few softer
						curves, all rendered in matte plastics. You can choose the Neon color option, whose blue and red Joy-Con
						controllers give it a bit more personality. Either way, the centerpiece of the Switch is a gray rectangle
						with the display on it.
					</p>
					<p>
						The dock, a rather dull rectangle of gray plastic by default, is more interesting than its appearance would
						indicate. There's a space for the Switch to slide into, which contains a hidden USB Type-C connector, plus a
						port for the AC adapter to attach. The side and back of the dock contain a total of three USB ports for
						plugging in accessories and an HDMI output to connect to your monitor or TV, covered by a moulded flap that
						aims to keep your cables tidy.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mechanically, however, the Switch is very smart. With the Joy-Cons attached to its side rails, the console
						behaves like a large handheld. Alternatively, you can slide the Joy-Cons off and use them separately in
						tabletop mode. When you play this way, you can lay the Switch flat, or prop it up on its built-in stand.
						Finally, there's TV mode, where the console plugs into the included dock to play your games on a separate
						display. This is the only way you're able to play your games at their maximum 1080p resolution (in handheld
						mode, they default to 720p), but the console's portability is very useful. It's how many other Switch users
						and I tend to play. Handheld mode is so prevalent that Nintendo's newer Switch Lite cannot dock to a TV at
						all.
					</p>

					<p>
						The console uses game cards for its physical media, which you insert into a covered port on the top of the
						system. You'll also find the power button, a 3.5-millimeter jack for attaching headphones or speakers and a
						volume button on the Switch's top edge.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the bottom you'll find the USB Type-C charging port, which draws power into the console's 4,310-mAh
						internal battery, either directly from the included power adapter, or via the docking station, filling up in
						around 3 hours. If you lift up the kickstand on the back of the console, you'll also find the microSD card
						slot, which allows you to expand your downloadable game storage.
					</p>
					<h3 class="add-margin-top">Nintendo Switch specs</h3>
					<p>
						With the Joy-Cons attached, the Switch measures 4 x 9.4 x 0.55 inches (10.1 x 23.8 x 1.3 centimeters) and
						weighs 0.88 pounds (around 400 grams), making it the smallest and lightest main console of this generation.
						The built-in display is a 720p LCD screen and is also a touch screen, with the processing handled by an
						Nvidia custom Tegra CPU.
					</p>
					<p>
						Both Joy-Con controllers use rechargeable batteries, estimated to have a 20-hour life and to charge to full
						capacity in around 3.5 hours. You can power up the Joy-Cons by either plugging them into the side rails in
						the main Switch console, or into various specially designed accessories, most of which are sold separately.
						(The system comes with a single Joy-Con holder, which approximates the look and feel of a traditional
						controller.)
					</p>
					<p>
						The Switch is not as powerful as the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox One, let alone the PS4 Pro or Xbox One X.
						However, thanks to its popular exclusive franchises and unique play opportunities, the Switch doesn't have
						to match the competition's graphical abilities to draw in players.
					</p>
					<h3 class="add-margin-top">Nintendo Switch controls</h3>
				</div>

					<p>
						The Joy-Cons are as versatile as the console itself. You can use them together as two halves of a single
						game pad, or turn them on their sides to use them as two seperate controllers (minus a pair of shoulder
						buttons) for local co-op and multiplayer gaming.
					</p>
					<p>
						You'll find HD Rumble in the Joy-Cons for in-game feedback, and an accelerometer and a gyroscope for motion
						control in both Joy-Cons. However, in the right Joy-Con there's an additional IR sensor, which you can use
						to control certain games, and an NFC sensor for Nintendo's Amiibo figurines. These unlock extra content in
						specific titles.
					</p>
					<p>
						The controllers in the box are accompanied by a few accessories. These include the Joy-Con straps, which
						slide onto the sides of the controllers to give you a more secure grip when you're using the motion
						controls, as well as more comfortable shoulder buttons if you're using single controllers. There's also the
						Joy-Con Grip, which lets you slide both controllers into a more familiar game pad shape. This may be good
						for players who are used to PlayStation or Xbox controllers. But despite playing on a PlayStation 4 for most
						of this console generation, I rarely use the Grip. Using the Joy-Cons separately is surprisingly
						comfortable.
					</p>
					<h3 class="add-margin-top">Nintendo Switch multiplayer and online
					</h3>
					<p>
						If you want to play first-party Nintendo games online (this includes games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
						and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe), back up your saves in the cloud, play NES and SNES games, or access the companion
						smartphone app, you'll have to subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online.
					</p>
					<p>
						Switch Online has some peculiar characteristics. You don't need to pay for multiplayer for every game, but
						on the other hand, only certain games support cloud games. The smartphone app is also necessary for online
						voice chat, as the console itself can't do this.
					</p>
					<p>
						The prices for Nintendo Switch Online are $3.99 per month, $7.99 for three months and $19.99 for 12 months,
						with a fourth "family" option of $34.99 per month for eight Nintendo accounts in the same household.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you want to use your Switch only for local multiplayer, then you don't need to pay for membership. You
						can pair up to four Joy-Cons to a single Switch console, but you can also connect up to eight consoles
						together locally for massive multiplayer matches.
					</p>

					<h3>Nintendo Switch battery life</h3>
					<p>
						The launch Nintendo Switch (model number HAC-001) is rated to last between 2.5 and 6.5 hours, according to
						Nintendo's own estimates, while the updated version — which you can tell from the original via its full-red
						packaging and its different model number, HAC-001(-01) — manages a much more convenient 4.5 to 9 hours. Make
						sure this is the version you buy today if you want the best Switch experience, but the battery life is the
						only difference between the two versions of the console.
					</p>
					<p>
						In our Switch battery life test, Nintendo's claims seemed to be fairly accurate. Playing an eight-player
						game of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate until the console died, the launch Switch lasted 2 hours and 45 minutes,
						while the updated Switch managed 4 hours and 50 minutes. The Switch Lite made it to the 3:50 mark, for
						reference. All three versions of the Switch will last for plenty of time, but this test just confirms that
						the original Switch is outclassed by the new Switch and the Switch Lite.
					</p>

					<h3>Bottom line</h3>
					<p>
						The Nintendo Switch had a very strong start back in 2017 and has only grown stronger since then. More and
						more non-Nintendo developers are flocking to have their games appear on the platform, and Nintendo has
						addressed many criticisms of the launch-day console with a new, cheaper form factor in the Switch Lite and
						an upgrade to the battery life.
					</p>

					<p>
						You'll have to accept a loss of graphical capability if you play on the Switch instead of a rival console,
						and Nintendo's online service, with its confusing features, may accidentally trick people into buying it
						when it's either unnecessary or unhelpful for the games they play. It's also unfortunate that Nintendo
						discounts its products so infrequently. It's rare you'll find the Switch on sale, and when it is, it tends
						to disappear very quickly.
					</p>
					<p>
						A large group of Switch players decided to buy the console as soon as they knew it was a Nintendo product,
						due to the build quality and exclusive game franchises that are synonymous with the company. That said, the
						Switch has one of the widest third-party game libraries ever found on a Nintendo console. Even if you aren't
						a fan of the first-party Nintendo games, being able to enjoy your favorite RPG, shooter or strategy title on
						a console that you can play anywhere is a tempting offer. It's for these reasons that the future still looks
						bright for the Switch, even as Microsoft and Sony look to release the PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles by the
						end of 2020.
