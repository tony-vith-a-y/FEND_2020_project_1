					<p>
						It may not be stunningly svelte. And it may not deliver earsplitting explosions from movie soundtracks. But
						for the money, the 65-inch Vizio P-Series Quantum X ($1,198) delivers solid color performance in a crisp 4K
						TV. It also includes some intelligent upscaling to keep the picture clear when you're watching standard HD
						material (which you will be, most of the time).
					</p>
					<p>
						Vizio packs a lot into this top-of-the-line model, including a full-array LED backlight with multiple active
						zones. The set supports the major high dynamic range (HDR) formats for boosting color intensity. And its
						picture skills place it above lower-priced 4K models from Hisense and TCL — and in contention against models
						that cost thousands more from LG, Samsung and Sony.
					</p>
					<p>
						Does it have flaws? Certainly gamers and music lovers will think so, but the trade-off results in a very
						respectable 4K picture at a very competitive price, making it one of the best TVs available in terms of
						value for the dollar.
					</p>
					<h3 class="h3addTopMargin">Vizio P-Series Quantum X (PX65-G1) price and availability</h3>
					<p>
						The Vizio P-Series Quantum X is the capo di tutti of Vizio's TV lines. And for Vizio, traditionally a value
						TV manufacturer, it is priced accordingly. Our 65-inch test model (PX65-G1) was $1,198. If you want to go
						bigger, the 75-inch P-Series Quantum X (PX75-G1) is $1,699. Why the huge price jump? Because aside from the
						bigger glass, it entails even more local dimming zones: 480 versus the 384 in the 65-inch set.
					</p>
					<p>
						But this won't be the top Vizio for long. The company plans to introduce the first Vizio OLED set later this
						year, which promises to strike fear into the hearts of currently premium-priced OLEDs from LG and Sony.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you're looking for something a little more budget friendly, Vizio's M-Series Quantum set in the same size
						represents a savings of about $600. While the lower-priced model is still a 4K set that supports HDR, it
						doesn't have quite the picture quality. (It uses only 90 local dimming zones, for example, compared to the
						384 zones in the P-Series Quantum X.)
					</p>
					<h3 class="h3addTopMargin">Vizio P-Series Quantum X (PX65-G1) design</h3>
					<p>
						Sitting on a credenza, the 65-inch Vizio P-Series Quantum X rests on two silver arched legs located at
						either end of the panel.

						That gives it enough height for a thin sound bar, Blu-ray player or set-top box to fit under its profile.
						The set's black plastic chassis has an even, narrow bezel and the simple V logo is discretely set over to
						the far right of the bottom border of the display.

					<p>
						For those looking to do a wall placement, the P-Series Quantum X works with VESA-compliant 400 x
						400-millimeter brackets. The set weighs just over 54 pounds without the stand. Not that we're body shaming,
						but that's a bit on the heavy side, so you should get a sturdy mounting system.
					</p>
					<h3 class="h3addTopMargin">Vizio P-Series Quantum X (PX65-G1) ports</h3>
					<p>
						The P-Series Quantum X has a typical array of inputs and outputs. For HDMI connections, there are five ports
						(two mounted to the side and three more along the bottom). The HDMI connections are 2.0a, with one 120-Hz
						1.4 input intended for gaming. There is also a component video input and a single USB port. Another USB port
						would have been helpful, considering the number of devices — such as powered antennas and media storage
						devices — that could use a USB connection.
					</p>

				<div class="theReview">
					<p>
						Analog and digital audio outputs are also on the back, as well as a coaxial connection for cable or an
						antenna. For networking, there's an Ethernet port and built-in 802.11ac dual-band Wi-Fi. Bluetooth — for,
						say, a pair of headphones — is not built in.
					</p>
					<h3 class="h3addTopMargin">Vizio P-Series Quantum X (PX65-G1) performance</h3>
					<p>
						There's no doubt that Vizio has included some features in the P-Series Quantum X set that have a direct
						payoff when it comes to picture quality. The quantum dot film, which adds color depth, and the full-array
						LED backlight with 384 active dimming zones deliver significant benefits. There's minimal flaring around
						bright objects on the screen, for example, and almost no halo effects around highlights in the picture. The
						active dimming zones also enable some nifty picture processing tricks, such as automatically detecting when
						you're watching a letterboxed movie and then making the top and bottom bars even darker. The result: some of
						the deepest blacks we've seen outside of an OLED TV.

				<div class="theReview">
					<p>
						Of course, we're basing most of our judgments on the assumption that you put the Vizio P-Series Quantum X in
						its best calibrated picture mode. In calibrated mode, most of the image settings are automatically adjusted
						to 50%, and motion-control video processing is turned off to reduce potential artifacts and noise.
					</p>
					<p>
						One annoying and awkward picture adjustment on the Quantum X is the HDR setting. Rather than being grouped
						with other picture settings, you'll find it under the main menu, then you have to dig through several
						submenus (settings, input settings, and then the specific input) to locate "Full UHD Color." A simple on/off
						toggle under picture settings would be more logical.
					</p>
					<p>
						In tests comparing the P-Series Quantum X with some of the leading high-end TVs in the market, the set did
						very well. It delivered 99.95% of the Rec. 709 color gamut, for example — a certainly respectable result,
						which reflects the fact that quantum dot films can enhance color performance.
					</p>
					<p>
						Color-accuracy tests (according to our measurements with an X-Rite colorimeter and CalMan calibration
						software) turned in a Delta-E number of 2.5 (the closer to 0, the better). That may sound about average, but
						there are more nuances to these results. Consider that the LG B8 OLED posted a 1.7 in our tests, which is
						one of our best scores, but the very highly regarded Sony A9G OLED came in at 2.7, ostensibly worse than the
						Vizio P-Series Quantum X, but in practice, one of the best sets we've ever reviewed. Right in between was
						the less expensive Hisense H9F with a Delta E score of 2.3, even though overall, its picture is not as
						consistently accurate as any of the aforementioned sets.
					</p>
					<p>
						Of course, the proof is in the movie viewing. Watching the Blu-ray 4K HDR version of Arrival, subtle oranges
						and yellows looked spot-on, and there was minimal picture noise. The active dimming also helped with the
						scene of the helicopter ascending from Louise Banks' home, allowing us to clearly see the car parked in the
						shadows. Occasionally, the video processing in calibrated mode still looked a little heavy-handed: It made
						the actors seem as if they were standing in front of a flat backdrop. There was also some minimal banding in
						color gradients, like gray skies or the opening fog scene in Blade Runner 2049, but nothing viewers would
						find distracting.
					</p>
					<p>
						Details jumped out in most of what we watched, demonstrating that the P-Series Quantum X did a great job
						with 4K material. In Avengers: Endgame, the 4K disc yielded excellent image details, such as Robert Downey
						Jr.'s worry lines as his spaceship drifts directionless out in space. Such details will motivate you to get
						a 4K TV, although it can reveal too much, such as the fact that Chris Evans as Captain America is wearing
						too much makeup in some scenes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Everyday viewing will doubtless comprise a lot of standard HD programming. Fortunately, the P-Series does a
						good job upscaling such material. An old standby Skyfall Blu-ray disc with challenging action sequences was
						handled easily without adding any artifacts or creating any dropouts. Colors remained true and details in
						shadows were still visible. A test with an HD version of Gravity also showed how well Vizio has improved its
						upscaling; as Sandra Bullock spun out into the darkness of space, there was no halo effect and stars
						twinkling in the distance still looked sharp.
					</p>
					<h3 class="h3addTopMargin">Vizio P-Series Quantum X (PX65-G1) gaming performance</h3>
					<p>
						For 4K gamers (and don't we all want to be 4K gamers?), the Vizio P-Series Quantum X is a bit of a
						disappointment. On a 4K HDMI port with the special game mode enabled to reduce latency, we measured a lag
						time of 35.1 milliseconds. In general, anyone shooting it out in a multiplayer game like Halo isn't going to
						notice a lag time of 20 ms or less, but above that, you'll find you're at a distinct disadvantage against
						the competition.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, to address this issue, Vizio has essentially added an extra, fifth HDMI port specifically for
						gamers — but it only supports 1080p. The benefit is that it strips away all the video processing that adds
						to lag, turning in a much more respectable 23.8-ms time in game mode. That's better, but still not a stellar
						result.
					</p>
					<h3 class="h3addTopMargin">Vizio P-Series Quantum X (PX65-G1) audio</h3>
					<p>
						The other obvious vulnerability of the Quantum X was its sound quality. Using a pair of 10-watt speakers,
						the sound settings of the P-Series Quantum X don't include any preset sound modes. Other TVs include modes
						for music, movies, sports and other programming. This P-Series includes a DTS surround-sound mode and volume
						leveling, but no presets. There's also no equalizer for tweaking the audio, which is a shame, because it
						sure could use it.

					<h3>Vizio P-Series Quantum X (PX65-G1) smart TV features</h3>
					<p>
						Vizio has received a fair amount of criticism for its SmartCast interface, but it has been steadily
						improving it. Version 3.5 here is quicker and less clunky, but it still offers a lot less than Roku- or
						Android TV-based models from the likes of Sony or TCL. We like Vizio's WatchFree section, which aggregates
						hundreds of free streaming sources, and there are apps for major services, from Sesame Street to Tidal.
						However, most people will find SmartCast overlooks one or another of their favorite services, such as
						Disney+. (Though Vizio assures us that both Disney+ and Apple TV+ will be coming to SmartCast TVs sometime
						this spring.)
					</p>
					<p>
						If you want more apps, you'll have to use the built-in Chromecast support to stream them from a mobile
						device. Chromecast supports many, many more apps — including HBO, Disney+ and Showtime — than Vizio's
						SmartCast. However, some people will be annoyed at the idea of having to use their smartphone or Android
						tablet as a remote control. If SmartCast's limited app selection leaves you feeling underwhelmed, there's
						always the option of getting a Roku Premiere ($29.99) or Roku Streaming Stick ($49.99) and skipping Vizio's
						SmartCast entirely in favor of Roku's rich app selection and easy-to-follow interface.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is an Alexa option (as well as support for Apple HomeKit and Google Assistant) if you want to use
						voice commands. However, you have to use it via your own existing smart speaker, like the Amazon Echo. It is
						not built into the set.
					</p>
					<h3 class="h3addTopMargin">Vizio P-Series Quantum X (PX65-G1) remote control</h3>
					<p>
						The supplied remote control for the P-Series could use an update. It's thin enough and curved to rest
						comfortably in the hand, but it lacks backlit keys, making it difficult to find buttons in the dark.
					</p>

				</figure>
				<div class="theReview">
					<p>
						There are dedicated buttons for services like Vudu, Netflix, Amazon, iHeartRadio and Crackle. But there's no
						guide button, which can lead to some nonintuitive navigation. On WatchFree, for example, you have to hit OK
						on the remote, which tells you the channel, and then select OK again (within a few seconds) to get a guide.
						One button would be easier.
					</p>
					<h3 class="h3addTopMargin">Bottom line</h3>
					<p>
						To get this level of picture performance at this price, you have to give up something. With the Vizio
						P-Series Quantum X (PX65-G1), the company has cut corners in sound quality and some other minor niceties to
						achieve its relatively affordable price tag. There are cheaper 65-inch 4K models out there, such as the
						Hisense H9F, which is more than $300 less, but they can't match the picture quality of the P-Series. More
						expensive sets like the Sony A9G OLED still best the Quantum X in sharpness and image fidelity, but they can
						cost upward of a $1,000 more.
